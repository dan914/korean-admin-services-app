# 🔧 Flutter Setup Alternative

## Option 1: Quick Fix - Use VSCode Flutter

If you have Flutter extension in VSCode:
1. Open VSCode in the project folder
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Type "Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor"
4. This will use VSCode's Flutter installation

## Option 2: Manual Flutter Download (Recommended)

```bash
# Download Flutter SDK
cd ~
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_arm64_3.32.8-stable.zip

# Extract it
unzip flutter_macos_arm64_3.32.8-stable.zip

# Add to PATH permanently
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload terminal
source ~/.zshrc

# Test Flutter
flutter --version
flutter doctor
```

## Option 3: Use Web Browser Instead

Since your apps are already web-compatible, you can run them directly in the browser:

### For Main App:
```bash
cd "/Users/yujumyeong/coding projects/행정사/행정도우미"
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then open: http://localhost:8080

### For Admin App:
```bash
cd "/Users/yujumyeong/coding projects/행정사/admin_app"  
python3 -m http.server 8081
```
Then open: http://localhost:8081

## Option 4: Fix Current Flutter

The issue is that your local Flutter needs to be a proper Git clone:

```bash
# Remove current Flutter
rm -rf "/Users/yujumyeong/coding projects/행정사/flutter"

# Clone Flutter properly
cd "/Users/yujumyeong/coding projects/행정사"
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git flutter

# Add to PATH for this session
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/yujumyeong/coding projects/행정사/flutter/bin"

# Test
flutter --version
```

## 🎯 Quick Test Without Flutter

You can test the Supabase connection directly:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**:
   https://app.supabase.com/project/xgmswifetbmttyrtzjpv/editor

2. **Insert a test record manually**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO applications (
     form_data,
     name, 
     phone,
     email,
     status
   ) VALUES (
     '{"step_1": "test"}',
     'Manual Test',
     '010-0000-0000', 
     'test@test.com',
     'pending'
   );
   ```

3. **Check it appears**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM applications ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

This confirms your database is working while we fix Flutter!

## ⚡ Quickest Solution

If you just want to test quickly:
1. Use Option 2 (manual download) - takes 2 minutes
2. Or use Option 3 (web browser) - works immediately
3. Or manually test in Supabase dashboard
