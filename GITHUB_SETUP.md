# GitHub Setup Instructions

## 🚀 How to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name**: `korean-admin-services-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Korean Administrative Services App with Admin Panel"
   - **Privacy**: Choose Private or Public
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/yujumyeong/coding projects/행정사"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/korean-admin-services-app.git

# Or if using SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/korean-admin-services-app.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### 3. Alternative: If You Want to Use 'main' Instead of 'master'

```bash
# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. For Private Repository with Token Authentication

If your repository is private and you're using HTTPS, you'll need a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with 'repo' scope
3. Use the token as your password when pushing:

```bash
git push -u origin master
# Username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
# Password: YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### 5. Verify Upload

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository page:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/korean-admin-services-app
```

You should see all your files uploaded!

## 🔒 Security Notes

Before pushing to a public repository:

1. **Check for sensitive data**:
   ```bash
   # Search for potential secrets
   grep -r "password\|api_key\|secret" . --exclude-dir=.git
   ```

2. **Ensure .gitignore is working**:
   ```bash
   # Check what will be pushed
   git status
   ```

3. **Remove sensitive files if found**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached path/to/sensitive/file
   echo "path/to/sensitive/file" >> .gitignore
   git commit -m "Remove sensitive file"
   ```

## 🏷️ Creating a Release

After pushing, you can create a release:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Choose a tag version (e.g., v1.0.0)
4. Add release notes
5. Attach APK/IPA files if available

## 🔄 Future Updates

To push future changes:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Your descriptive message"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## 🤝 Collaboration

To add collaborators:
1. Go to Settings → Manage access
2. Click "Invite a collaborator"
3. Enter their GitHub username or email

## 📱 CI/CD Setup (Optional)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for:

Create `.github/workflows/flutter.yml` for CI/CD pipeline.
