## 🔄 Next Steps for APK Building

### Option 1: Complete Local Setup (Recommended)
1. **Install Java manually** (requires admin password):
   ```bash
   # Download from: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
   # Or use system preferences to install Java
   ```

2. **Configure Android SDK**:
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME="/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools"
   export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
   sdkmanager "platforms;android-33" "build-tools;33.0.0"
   flutter config --android-sdk $ANDROID_HOME
   ```

3. **Build APKs**:
   ```bash
   cd "행정도우미" && flutter build apk --release
   cd "../admin_app" && flutter build apk --release
   ```

### Option 2: Use Automated Script
Run the pre-made setup script:
```bash
./setup_android_and_build_apks.sh
```

### Option 3: Docker Build (No Java Installation Required)
```bash
./docker_build_apks.sh
```
*Requires Docker Desktop installed*

### Option 4: GitHub Actions (Cloud Build)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions
3. APKs will be built automatically and available as artifacts

## 📋 Build Scripts Created
